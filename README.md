# Node.js Typescript Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mastertinner/nodejs-typescript-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mastertinner/nodejs-typescript-boilerplate)

A minimalistic boilerplate to use Node.js with Typescript

There are two ways of running your projects. One is to run the typescript directly using [TS Node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node). The other one is to compile your TypeScript code to Javascript and then run that using plain node. Both are valid options for production, depending on the environment you are running your app in. For development, the direct mode is recommended.

## Run directly

1. Run `npm start`

## Compile

1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run `node dist`
